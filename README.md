### The Soup of Ideas

This is where ideas get born and mature, or die.

## Birth Pool - Where Ideas Get Born
#### pool.md 

The Birth Pool is a list of rough ideas, many not fit for survival (read: stupid stuff I come up with that can't ever be realized).

Viable ideas get out of the pool and earn their place in the incubator.

## Incubator - Where Ideas Mature
### incubator/

Each viable idea gets refined in its own file, where a team of scientists analyses their competitors and evaluates the chance of realization.
Either they die in the process and get placed in the graveyard, or they survive and get their own habitat (repository).

## Graveyard - Where Ideas Go To Die
### graveyard/

Dead ideas end up here, where they get dissected for causes of death or the necromancers get their hands on them.
